Perspective projection rays all have their origins at the same location, called
the eye. Each ray has a slightly different direction, causing the image to have
depth, and objects get smaller as they are get farther away. In comparision, an
orthographic procection's rays all have the same direction, but different
origins. This causes an appearance of objects that don't get smaller as they get
farther away.
