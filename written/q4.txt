The three cases for ray-sphere intersection are:
    1. A not-intersection (a miss)
    2. An intersection where the ray enters and exits the sphere at two distinct
       locations.
    3. An intersection where the ray is tangent to the edge of the sphere, with
       only one distinct point of contact.
