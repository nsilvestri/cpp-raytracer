The Blinn-Phong shading model approximates the tendency for light to reflect off
a surface with respect to the normal, causing specular highlights to appear on
the surfaces of objects. This effect models the glossiness of a surface. It is
calculated by comparing the offset between the ray bisecting the angle of the
light ray (called the "half vector") and view ray with the normal vector. The
closer the half vector and the normal vector, the more light from the light 
source that is directly reflected. This can be further modified with a value
called the Phong exponent, which specifies how quickly the reflective falloff
is; in other words, how sharp the reflective highlight is.
